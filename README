I cannot post the code to my cs378 Game Technology project,
since it was for a class. Instead, I have uploaded some
videos of the game.

The game is basically 3D pong, but each player can fire
projectiles which can stun the other paddle. You can also
pick up a shield powerup (the green balls) which will 
protect you from a single projectile hit. A normal paddle is
yellow, a paddle with a shield is blue, and a stunned paddle is
red.
